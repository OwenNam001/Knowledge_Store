<< Git Pull and Push Branches >>

< Main Branch Preparation >
- The team leader should create a new GitHub repo.
- Each member of the team should clone this repo to their local computer. 🚨git clone <HTTPS link>

- The team leader creates a file on main branch (local computer) add commit a file called "data_exploration.py" 
  and then push their changes to GitHub. 🚨git add . ➡️ git commit -m '<description of the commit>' ➡️ git push
- Team members should then pull these changes to their local machines. 🚨 git pull

< Each member Sub Branch Preparation >
- each team member should create a new sub branch "<name>/branching_exercise" 🚨 git checkout -b <name>/branching_exercise 
  checkout : move to another branch or move to previous commit
  checkout -b : while creating a branch moving to the branch at the sametime
- each team member should add and commit a file "<name>.txt" on each sub branch and commit 🚨git add . ➡️ git commit -m '<description of the commit>'
- each team member should push their respective branches to GitHub. 🚨git push origin <name>/branching_exercise

< Each member wants to modify other team member's file >
- each team member should checkout the main branch. 🚨 git checkout main  : Move to main brtanch
- Make sure branch list on local computer and remote repository 🚨 git branch -a
- Maks sure current located branch name 🚨 git status
- While on main, everyone should create a new branch with the name of the branch you want to check on local computer 🚨 git checkout -b <name of your colleague>/branching_exercise
- At the moment, this branch is empty, so you need to pull the branch of your colleague into your computer. 🚨 git pull origin <name of your colleague>/branching_exercise


<< Merging Into main locally >>
